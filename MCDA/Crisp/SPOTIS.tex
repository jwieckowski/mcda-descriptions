The Stable Preference Ordering Towards Ideal Solution (SPOTIS) method was introduced in 2020 \cite{dezert2020spotis}. It is one of a technique that proves to be resistant to rank reversal phenomenon \cite{shekhovtsov2021new}. Main assumptions of the method should be shortly recalled \cite{paradowski2021results}. \\

\noindent \textbf{Step 1.} Define the bounds of the problem - min and max bounds of classical MCDM problem must be defined to transform MCDM problem form ill-defined to well-defined.

\begin{equation}
\left[S_{n}^{\min }, S_{n}^{\max }\right]=\left[x_{1}, x_{2}\right]
\end{equation}

where, $n$ - criterion number, $x_1$ - min bound, $x_2$ - max bound. \\

\noindent \textbf{Step 2.} Define the ideal solution point - define vector which includes maximum or minimum from bounds for specific criterion depending on criterion type. For profit type, the max value should be taken, for cost type, min value.

\begin{equation}
S^{\star}=\left(S_{1}^{\star}, S_{2}^{\star}, S_{3}^{\star}\right)
\end{equation}

\noindent \textbf{Step 3.} Compute normalized distance matrix - for each alternative $A_{i}$ (i= 1, $\ldots$ , M),compute its normalized distance with respect to ideal solution for each criteria $C_{j}$ (j= 1, $\ldots$ , N ).

\begin{equation}
d_{i j}=\frac{\left|A_{i j}-S_{j}^{*}\right|}{\left|S_{j}^{\max }-S_{j}^{\min }\right|}
\end{equation}

\noindent \textbf{Step 4.} Compute normalized averaged distance - for each criteria $C_{j}$ (j= 1, $\ldots$ , N ) take into account its weight and calculate final preference by executing following equation.

\begin{equation}
\bar{p}_{j}=\sum_{j=1}^{N} w_{j} d_{i j}
\end{equation}

\noindent \textbf{Step 5.} Rank criteria by preference - values should be ranked in ascending order.
