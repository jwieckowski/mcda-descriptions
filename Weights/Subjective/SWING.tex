The method based on the assumption that expert is allowed to change one criterion from worst outcome to best \cite{monat2009benefits}. Technique requires to indicate which swing form the wort to best outcome would have the greatest, the second greatest etc. improvement. Based on that, the criterion with the most preferred swing is treated as the most important factor and receive $100$ points. Other criteria relevance is calculated as the percentage of the greatest swing \cite{zardari2015weighting}. Then, the derived values are normalized and indicate the final weights. The main advantage of this method is that it take into account the range of each criterion. Moreover, it is a relatively simple and intuitive method. On the other hand, it does not allow for direct comparison of criteria importance.
