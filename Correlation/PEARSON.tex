When preference values calculated for alternatives are to be compared, the Pearson correlation coefficient can be used \cite{benesty2009pearson}. Cross-correlation between vectors is used \cite{zebende2011dcca}. It is often used when comparing real signals. The formula used to calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient is shown below (\ref{eq:pearson}).


\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{lcl}
\rho(a, b)=\frac{E(a b)}{\sigma_{a} \sigma_{b}}
\end{array}
\label{eq:pearson}
\end{equation}

where $\sigma_{a}$ means preference for alternative $i$ from first method, $\sigma_{b}$ is the preference for alternative $i$ from second method and $E$ is a cross-correlation between $a$ and $b$.
