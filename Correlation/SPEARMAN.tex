As with the Pearson coefficient, the Spearman correlation coefficient is used when comparing preference values of alternatives \cite{myers2004spearman}. Its use is recommended when not following the normal bivarate distribution of rankings \cite{hauke2011comparison}. The calculation of this coefficient is shown below (\ref{eq:sp}).

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{lcl}
r_{s}=1-\frac{6 \cdot \sum d_{i}^{2}}{N \cdot\left(N^{2}-1\right)}
\end{array}
\label{eq:sp}
\end{equation}

where $d_i$ - distance between ranked alternatives in both rankings, $N$ - amount of alternatives.
